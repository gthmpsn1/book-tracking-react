# Gabriel's Book Tracking Project


### Concept of This Project

A bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library.

### App Functionality

- The main page displays a list of "shelves" which contains a number of books.

- When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.

- The search page has a text input that may be used to find books.
